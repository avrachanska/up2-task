                Introduction
            </h4>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    There have been many pivotal moments along the timeline of chemistry research. Parkes’ development of an
                    early synthetic polymer in 1862 paved the way for the U.S. oil boom of the latter part of the 19th century
                    as well as the modern petrochemical industry. Baekeland’s discovery of Bakelite in 1907 showed the world
                    the immense potential of plastics in household use. Then in 1935, the invention of nylon by a team of DuPont
                    chemists under Wallace Carothers brought about industrial-scale plastics via one of the most
                    commercially successful synthetic polymers in history.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    But what if similar discoveries could give rise to alternative materials, chemicals and molecules that could
                    minimize or even eliminate some of the industrial waste of existing processes, from sustainable sources?
                    That is the promise of green chemistry.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    According to the Center for Green Chemistry &amp; Green Engineering at Yale, “Green chemistry is the design
                    of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous
                    substances.”

                <p class="text-muted">
                    The problem this subject addresses is a vital one for future generations: how to provide the benefits of
                    modern chemistry without generating toxic byproducts. While traditional chemicals have been engineered to
                    do amazing things, they can have consequences which are difficult to contain or re-process, and often
                    expensive to manage.

                measuring earth impact
            </h4>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    While green chemistry’s effectiveness can be measured in terms of emissions levels—how much of a reduction
                    has been achieved in levels of CO2, NOx, SOx, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), particulate matter,
                    etc.—renewable chemistry in particular goes further. It introduces additional factors such as waste,
                    landfill requirements, depletion of mineral reserves, and impact on air, water and soil.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    The key to understanding the renewable chemistry movement is sustainability at the source of the value
                    chain. Renewable raw materials derived from sources such as plants (animals, too, in some cases), provide
                    for ongoing feedstock sources, compared with the finite fossil fuels used in large volumes today. Further,
                    an important principal is that renewable chemicals should never remain a long-term environmental problem
                    once products made from them are discarded. They are recyclable or biodegradable within a reasonable time
                    period. They are produced using processes that don’t consume much water. To qualify as a renewable chemical,
                    then, the substance has to make the grade from the beginning to the end of its useful life in terms of the
                    raw materials, processes, waste matter, emissions and byproducts. That means considering the physical
                    footprint of a particular chemical over its entire lifecycle.
                </p>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    For example, a renewable chemistry candidate would ideally produce no (or at least a very low level of )
                    harmful emissions. Its waste disposal would not be time consuming, hazardous or expensive. It would not
                    require large volumes of landfill real estate, and would have the benefits of requiring little water and
                    have minimal soil impact in harvesting its component parts, production, or disposal.

                Polylactic acid (PLA), for example, has grown in popularity as a renewable plastic. It has already found
                its way into food and consumer product packaging. Dutch chemical company Corbion, originally produced
                lactic acid for the baking industry, pivoted to become a green pioneer and now produces PLA for industrial
                uses. This renewable chemical now competes with ethylene to supply the plastics business. As PLA is made
                from the fermentation of a renewable resource—sugar—it can be regrown year after year, and it
                biodegrades.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Another renewable chemical pioneer, BioAmber, produces succinic acid which is used in polyurethanes,
                paints, coatings, adhesives, sealants, leather alternatives, food, cosmetics, plastics, lubricants, dyes
                and pharmaceuticals. Succinic acid itself can be produced in various ways, most of them petroleum based.
                But as BioAmber is committed to environmentally responsible chemistry, they create it from the fermentation
                of glucose followed by the purification of raw bio-based succinic acid. By using a renewable feedstock,
                reducing greenhouse gas emissions and substantially reducing energy consumption, the company is at the
                forefront of sustainable chemistry. It also boasts a low manufacturing plant carbon footprint. Result: its
                bio-based process brings about a 100% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 60% reduction in energy
                consumption relative to the existing method of producing succinic acid from petroleum.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                It isn’t only startups that are investing in renewable chemistry R&D. As a sign of its momentum, the
                largest traditional chemical players, like BASF, are increasingly committing research dollars to green
                initiatives. Green chemistry, then, is a major driver of molecular innovation. This vibrant area of chemical
                product design is actively bringing about environmental change as well as improvements in everyday life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                As such, green chemistry is gaining traction via a combination of factors. Green building codes specify
                the use of non-toxic materials; regulations either outlaw certain plastics or set the bar high in terms
                of elimination of emissions and byproducts, and taxation of waste acts to motivate chemical companies to
                find greener solutions.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                This is paralleled by rising public awareness of environmental responsibility as well as consumer preference
                for green products. In some cases, people will pay a premium to make a green consumer choice. The chemical
                industry is responding to this demand with plenty of innovation in the field of green chemistry.

                Barriers to overcome
            </h4>
            <p class="text-muted">
                While much progress has been made, there are still barriers to overcome. Perhaps the biggest roadblock is
                cost. Existing chemical feedstocks can take advantage of huge economies of scale. Massive refineries,
                crackers, and plastics plants are able to generate material at relatively low cost. The first bridge that
                green chemistry has to cross, therefore, is sufficient research funding to design promising new products in
                order to demonstrate potential viability. Once achieved, these products must then show a track record of
                demand to support capital investment on the order of tens of millions of dollars, and in many cases
                billions, to build the plants required to enable green chemicals to overcome traditional feedstocks.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Bottom line: As well as finding the right products, the green chemical sector also has to find the right
                cost basis. Yet the collapse of oil prices earlier in 2015 has increased the competitiveness of oil-based
                products. When oil was well over $100 a barrel, chemical producers had incentive to find renewable
                alternatives that might reduce their costs over the long term. But with trading at around $60 a barrel,
                they are less motivated to pour funds into green chemistry.
            </p>
            <p class="text-muted">
                Clearly, then, we are still at the early stages of the green chemistry movement. Much research is needed to
                create new compounds to replace petrochemical derivatives and meet the goals of renewability. The volume of
                this research is expected to grow rapidly over the coming decade. Pike Research forecasts that this will
                bring about direct cost savings as well as enabling chemical producers to avoid liability for environmental
                and social impacts brought about through the continued usage of traditional chemicals. At the end of the
                day, therefore, green chemistry is all about developing new substances that drive environmental change and
                improve our everyday lives.
