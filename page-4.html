            Barriers to overcome
        </h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
            While much progress has been made, there are still barriers to overcome. Perhaps the biggest roadblock is
            cost. Existing chemical feedstocks can take advantage of huge economies of scale. Massive refineries,
            crackers, and plastics plants are able to generate material at relatively low cost. The first bridge that
            green chemistry has to cross, therefore, is sufficient research funding to design promising new products in
            order to demonstrate potential viability. Once achieved, these products must then show a track record of
            demand to support capital investment on the order of tens of millions of dollars, and in many cases
            billions, to build the plants required to enable green chemicals to overcome traditional feedstocks.

            Bottom line: As well as finding the right products, the green chemical sector also has to find the right
            cost basis. Yet the collapse of oil prices earlier in 2015 has increased the competitiveness of oil-based
            products. When oil was well over $100 a barrel, chemical producers had incentive to find renewable
            alternatives that might reduce their costs over the long term. But with trading at around $60 a barrel,
            they are less motivated to pour funds into green chemistry.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            Clearly, then, we are still at the early stages of the green chemistry movement. Much research is needed to
            create new compounds to replace petrochemical derivatives and meet the goals of renewability. The volume of
            this research is expected to grow rapidly over the coming decade. Pike Research forecasts that this will
            bring about direct cost savings as well as enabling chemical producers to avoid liability for environmental
            and social impacts brought about through the continued usage of traditional chemicals. At the end of the
            day, therefore, green chemistry is all about developing new substances that drive environmental change and
            improve our everyday lives.
