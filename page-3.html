            Polylactic acid (PLA), for example, has grown in popularity as a renewable plastic. It has already found
            its way into food and consumer product packaging. Dutch chemical company Corbion, originally produced
            lactic acid for the baking industry, pivoted to become a green pioneer and now produces PLA for industrial
            uses. This renewable chemical now competes with ethylene to supply the plastics business. As PLA is made
            from the fermentation of a renewable resource—sugar—it can be regrown year after year, and it
            biodegrades.

            Another renewable chemical pioneer, BioAmber, produces succinic acid which is used in polyurethanes,
            paints, coatings, adhesives, sealants, leather alternatives, food, cosmetics, plastics, lubricants, dyes
            and pharmaceuticals. Succinic acid itself can be produced in various ways, most of them petroleum based.
            But as BioAmber is committed to environmentally responsible chemistry, they create it from the fermentation
            of glucose followed by the purification of raw bio-based succinic acid. By using a renewable feedstock,
            reducing greenhouse gas emissions and substantially reducing energy consumption, the company is at the
            forefront of sustainable chemistry. It also boasts a low manufacturing plant carbon footprint. Result: its
            bio-based process brings about a 100% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a 60% reduction in energy
            consumption relative to the existing method of producing succinic acid from petroleum.

            It isn’t only startups that are investing in renewable chemistry R&D. As a sign of its momentum, the
            largest traditional chemical players, like BASF, are increasingly committing research dollars to green
            initiatives. Green chemistry, then, is a major driver of molecular innovation. This vibrant area of chemical
            product design is actively bringing about environmental change as well as improvements in everyday life.

        <p class="text-muted">
            As such, green chemistry is gaining traction via a combination of factors. Green building codes specify
            the use of non-toxic materials; regulations either outlaw certain plastics or set the bar high in terms
            of elimination of emissions and byproducts, and taxation of waste acts to motivate chemical companies to
            find greener solutions.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            This is paralleled by rising public awareness of environmental responsibility as well as consumer preference
            for green products. In some cases, people will pay a premium to make a green consumer choice. The chemical
            industry is responding to this demand with plenty of innovation in the field of green chemistry.
